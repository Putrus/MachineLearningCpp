Lots of machine learning explanation are like

Good book:
title: Deep Learning Ian Goodfellow

4 algorithms explanation:

1. explanation in polish
2. graphics ilustration how algorithm works
3. mathematic explanation why algorithm works
4. pseudocode with algorithm implementation

What is neural network?
- is mathematic function, which has input and output data
- is calculation graph in which multidimensional arrays are transferred
- consists of layers and every layer has a certain number of neurons
- is universal approximator of a function that theoretically solves any supervised learning problem

Summary of chapters:
The first three chapters are the most important
1. Mathematical function as a calculation graph. Calculation of derivative using the chain rule.
2. Practical part. Training model using line regression and neural network to predict building prices.
3. Basic deep learning model. Improve algorithms from part 2 by creating new high level components: Layer, Model, Optimizer.
4. Sometimes to good prediction standard techniques aren't enough. Training tricks to improve probability of find good solution.
5. Convolutional neural networks. Standard architecture to images recognition. Creating CNN layers from scratch.
6. Recurrent neural network. Automatic differentiation. RNN are good for sequential data.
7. Do the some things like in chapters 1-6 but using PyTorch library.
