# Handwritten Digit Recognition using C++
This repository contains C++ project for recognizing handwritten digits using MNIST dataset. The implementation uses different algorithms like kNN and neural networks.

# About the MNIST dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of about 60000 handwritten digit images by 250 people.

# Usage
Download datasets from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ and unzip in dataset folder

If cmake can't find the gcc and g++, execute "cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ ..\" at the beginning
